<h1> How did your user testing sessions go? </h1>

<p> My user testing went well actually. So well, that I ended up changing my whole goal of the website. Instead of doing a website talking about my favorite sports team, I actually just made my own website of the team, but as an "informational guide". Hearing certain design feedback, as well as, some concerns, I just remade my website. </p>

<h1> What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received? </h1>

<p> Based on my feedback, like I said above, I made a new website. I added a navigation bar because that was a popular idea in my user tests. The navigation bar has links to each page and also a logo in the left to navigate back to the home page. There is also a navigation footer with a link the brings the user back to the top of the page. I also created a color gradient background. It wasn't a particular feedback idea, but when I thought of it, I thought it would add to my design a little bit better.

<h1>Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?</h1>

<p> One challenge that I faced was lining up my images side by side. I had to mess with the sizes to make all the images fit in these equal columns and rows. Once I finally figured it out, I was good from there. We didn't really learn this in class so i think that is why it was difficult.
