# Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.
Browsers are software programs used to access the internet from a device. They read and interpret content like PNG, JPG, CSS, and HTML, and then displays the web page.
It starts out by the user being presented with a user interface, which consists of the web tab, address bar, back and forward buttons etc. The browser, after taking in HTML and CSS, then uses a rendering engine to construct a DOM tree. After styling and visual instruction is taken in, a render tree is created, display the web page. The user interface and rendering engine are directed by the browser engine. All this communicating is done over a network because it's the networks job to provide the rendering engine the requested css and html documents. The web page finally goes through a layout phase and the page is created. The functionality of the website then relies on different programing languages which are controlled and directed by javascript interpreters.
The browsers I use are Google Chrome and Safari.
