<h1>
Forms I've Come Across While Browsing The Web
</h1>
  <p>
One of the most popular and commonly used forms in use on the web are search bars, particularly "Google's" search bar. I use Google as my main search engine so I use the search bar all day. That is where I enter my data in the web.

Another form I've come across is the text-entry form used on the University of Montana Moodle page. To log on, text-entry forms are used to have us enter in our username and password to log onto our Moodle page. Along with this form, a button form is used to sign in.
