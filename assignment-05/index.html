    <i>The Divergent Series</i> is a film trilogy about a women named Tris, who is a girl that lives in a world that is divided into 5 factions. These five factions are based on personality, virtue, and strength. Citizens are divided into them based on what they mutually value and are good at. These factions are called Abnegation (selfless), Erudite (intellectual), Dauntless (brave), Candor (honest), and Amity (peachful).

   As Tris chooses the Dauntless faction, throughout the movie, she realizes that she actually belongs to more than one faction. There are very few people who are like her, and so she has to hide who she is while she prepares for a war that is looming.
