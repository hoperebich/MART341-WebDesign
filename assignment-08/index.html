  Lyrics
  </h1>
  <p>
  Made a lot of money and I lost a lot, ayy
  <br />
  Chasing your dreams tend to cost a lot
  <br />
  Beat the odds and give 'em all something to talk about
  <br />
  Brand-new whip can't even fit inside the parking spot, ayy
  <br />
  Don't think I need you, don't think I need you
  <br />
  Quick as I met you, I'll leave you
  <br />
  <br />

  Adding up my totals, figured out that we ain't equal
  <br />
  Masking all your flaws, end of the day, baby, you see-through
  <br />
  Lotta sacrifices tryna take care of my people
  <br />
  You say, "Play your part, " and I was willing to come meet you
  <br />
  Flooded out your watch 'cause I ain't tripping, I don't need to, yeah
  <br />
  <br />

  He gave you a hundred when he had a hundred thousand
  <br />
  I gave you 20 with only lint in my pocket
  <br />
  But I ain't never trippin', yeah, you got it
  <br />
  Karma, she a bitch who don't forget one thing about it
  <br />
  <br />

  Used to hate being alone, now we locked in
  <br />
  Yeah, I knew you was the one when you walked in
  <br />
  Made me forget about 'em all when I had options
  <br />
  Now I'm rolling in this Rolls-Royce
  <br />
  Stars in the ceiling, it don't matter
  <br />
  I could have it all it, still won't matter
  <br />
  'Cause when I die, who knows where I'll go after
  <br />
  Tryna find my inner peace, yeah, that's something I gotta master
  <br />
  <br />

  Made a lot of money and I lost a lot, ayy
  <br />
  Chasing your dreams tend to cost a lot
  <br />
  Beat the odds and give 'em all something to talk about
  <br />
  Brand new whip can't even fit inside the parking spot, hey
  <br />
  Don't think I need you, don't think I need you
  <br />
  Don't think I need you, don't think I need you
  <br />
  Don't think I need you, don't think, don't think
  <br />
  <br />

  Ayy, lately I been smelling myself
  <br />
  Ayy, money over bitches what I'm telling myself
  <br />
  Yeah, slow down girl, don't get ahead of yourself
  <br />
  Got a lot of tricks that's under my belt, ayy
  <br />
  Only time I lose is when I'm losing my feelings
  <br />
  The only time I'm down is when I'm down for my niggas
  <br />
  The only time you beg is when you beg for forgiveness
  <br />
  And I ain't got no love in my heart 'cause it's missing
  <br />
  <br />

  Anything you wanted at the time, I woulda gave it to ya
  <br />
  I put my feelings to the side, I woulda saved it for ya
  <br />
  Now I don't wanna sit and talk 'bout what we coulda been
  (Ayy, yeah)
  <br />
  You be going off impulse
  <br />
  Telling me your problems with your kinfolks
  <br />
  Yeah, I shoulda knew what I was in for
  Yeah, I shoulda known that you would switch like a Nintendo
  <br />
  I guess everything good, I ain't good for ya what they meant though
  <br />
  <br />

  Made a lot of money and I lost a lot, ayy
  <br />
  Chasing your dreams tend to cost a lot
  <br />
  Beat the odds and give 'em all something to talk about
  <br />
  Brand-new whip can't even fit inside the parking spot, hey
  <br />
  Don't think I need you, don't think I need you
  Don't think I need you, don't think I need you
  Don't think I need you, don't think, don't think
